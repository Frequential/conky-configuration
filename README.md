# Conky configuration
###### DO NOT CREATE ISSUES IN THIS REPOSITORY, ISSUES ARE EXPECTED ON OTHER HARDWARE, CHANGES MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR YOUR USE CASE
I made this configuration in pair with my wallpaper. This means the color match and everthing is visible.

### Changes
If your hadrware doesn't match, you'll need to do modifications, I recommend heading over to the [Variables](http://conky.sourceforge.net/variables.html) and [Configurations](http://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html) docs.
It doesn't take much to learn how to use the tool and you'll end up with a very pretty widget!
