###### DO NOT CREATE ISSUES IN THIS REPOSITORY, ISSUES ARE EXPECTED ON OTHER HARDWARE, CHANGES MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR YOUR USE CASE
I made this configuration in pair with my wallpaper, this means the colors match, and everything is visible.

### Changes - IMPORTANT!
This configuration places the widget outside the default screen ([see here](https://github.com/Frequential/conky-configuration/blob/13eb3b586c34aedd21910f866691f211dd55deea/conky.conf#L56)) if you are not running a multi-monitor setup or your monitors have a different resolution, **you will need to change this**. Change the number to 0 to have a good start point.

If your hardware doesn't match, you'll need to do modifications. I recommend heading over to the [Variables](http://conky.sourceforge.net/variables.html) and [Configurations](http://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html) docs.
It doesn't take much to learn how to use the tool, and you'll end up with good looking widget!
